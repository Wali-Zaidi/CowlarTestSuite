## Installation

The overall application is divided into frontend and backend folders, for easier understanding and documentation. 

Prerequisites: A code editor, preferably VS Code, as that is the IDE this application was made in.

Note: Any code/command that is bold is to be written without the quotation marks ("")

To install :
      
   Frontend:
        Navigate to the frontend folder using the terminal. Once there, type in the following command
        
         npm install
         
This will install all of the dependancies with the exact version numbers as they were built with.
The frontend installation will take a while, so in the meantime, you can install the dependancies for the backend
        
Backend:
      Much like the frontend, navigate to the backend directory using the terminal, and in the terminal, type in
      
        npm install
        
This will, again, install all the dependancies that you might need to run the backend.
This installation will finish considerably faster than the frontend one.
        
## Usage

Running the application is as simple as installing it. Simply navigate to the frontend and backend, in different terminals on your IDE, and in both type: 

      npm start

This will start the react application on the frontend, and for the backend, will start the server.
