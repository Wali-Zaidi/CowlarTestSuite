## Installation

The overall application is divided into frontend and backend folders, for easier understanding and documentation. 

Prerequisites: A code editor, preferably VS Code, as that is the IDE this application was made in.

Note: Any code/command that is bold is to be written without the quotation marks ("")

To install :
      
   -Frontend:
        Navigate to the frontend folder using the terminal. Once there, type in the following command: **"npm                 install"** 
        This will install all of the dependancies with the exact version numbers as they were built with
        The frontend installation will take a while, so in the meantime, you can install the dependancies for the backend
        
   -Backend:
        Much like the frontend, navigate to the backend directory using the terminal, and in the terminal, type in:           **"npm install"**
        This will, again, install all the dependancies that you might need to run the backend.
        This installation will finish considerably faster than the frontend one.
        
## Usage

 Running the application is as simple as installing it. Simply navigate to the frontend and backend, in different terminals on your IDE, and in both
 type **"npm start"**. This will start the react application on the frontend, and for the backend, will start the server.
